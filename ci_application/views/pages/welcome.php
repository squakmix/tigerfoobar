			We believe in the power of information to transform the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Businesses frequently do bad things in the name of profit.
			Our goal is to make it profitable for companies to do the right thing.

			By sharing objective articles and facts about corporations and their products,
			as well as being part of a global peer review system, we can create a generation
			of consumer activists that makes the best possible decisions.
